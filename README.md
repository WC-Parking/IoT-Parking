## IoT Parking
The idea of this project is to have a parking lot with IoT capabilities; getting vacancy information and pushing it to cloud which proceeds to be relayed to the user. First phase of this project is to be able to get the vacancy information, analyse it through an IoT platform then sending it to a cloud database.
